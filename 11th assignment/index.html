                    Today, Alan Turing is famous for his work on cracking Nazi Germany’s Enigma code machine in 1939. But in 1936, Turing published a paper regarded as the founding piece on computer science. Turing came up with the concept of a universal machine.

                <td>
                    Konrad Zuse created what is considered the first programming language for computers in the early 1940s. It was called Plankalkul, and it could store codes, enabling engineers to carry out routine, repetitive tasks far more efficiently and quickly.

                    <td>
                        The next big development was Assembly language, a computer programming language that simplified the instructions to make a computer function. Also, in 1949 came Shortcode, used by Assembly Language and Shortcode

                    <td>Niklaus Wirth 1970 developed this programming language and named it after Blaise Pascal, the French mathematician. So easy to learn, it was used by Apple early on in its history.

                    <td> in 1983 Bjarne Stroustrup modified the C language at Bell Labs. The result was C++, which had some augmentations such as classes, templates, and virtual functions. C++ is now used in MS Office, Adobe Photoshop, and various types of high-performance software.

                        Brad Cox and Tom Love then developed Objective-C, the programming language used for Apple’s operating systems.</td><br>
