            <h3> Description </h3>
            <h4> Probably the most famous painting in the world is Leonardo da Vinci's La Gioconda, better known as Mona Lisa. This painting is a portrait of Madame Gherardini, personifying the ideal woman of the Renaissance. They tried to damage the painting more than once, and in 1911 it was also kidnapped, returning only 2 years later. Admiration for it truly knows no bounds: Napoleon Bonaparte even removed it from the museum and ordered to hang it in his own bedroom. The painting is officially declared priceless, which is not surprising, as this masterpiece is the best art of all time. The only existing price is its $ 3 billion insurance. Mona Lisa is currently kept in the Louvre, Paris.</h4>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <h4>In total, El Greco made at least seven copies of the oil painting "Christ Carrying the Cross", which testifies both to the importance of this work for the artist himself and to its incredible popularity during the artist's lifetime. El Greco focused primarily not on the divine, but on the humanity of Christ. Today, this masterpiece of art is kept at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</h4>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <h4>Girl with a Pearl Earring by Dutch artist Jan Vermeer is often referred to as the northern Mona Lisa. This is not only because of its extraordinary popularity, but also because the expression on the girl's face is difficult to capture and explain. Very little is known about the painting: it is not dated, the name of the girl depicted is unknown. In 2003, based on the novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier, a film was cut about the hypothetical creation of the painting. Besides stylistic differences, “Girl with a Pearl Earring” is technically not even a portrait, but “troni”, a Dutch word for a person's head, but not a complete portrait. In 1881, at an auction in The Hague, the painting was purchased for only two guilders and thirty cents. Between 2012 and 2014, when Mauritshuis was undergoing restoration, Girl with a Pearl Earring went on tour to the USA, Italy, and Japan. Everywhere it gathered huge crowds, which finally strengthened its status as one of the most famous paintings in history. The painting is kept in the Mauritshuis gallery in The Hague.</h4>

            <h4>The name of this painting Impression, soleil levant with the light hand of the journalist L. Leroy became the name of the artistic movement.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This painting, by Dutch artist Pieter Bruegel, is now housed in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels. The genius of the author makes it possible to express a strong social theme by showing it in a fairly simple way. Like many other great and famous art pieces, through the image of the defeated Icarus, Bregel also uses the theme of the fate and futility of human attempts to reach God.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <h4>The true name of this painting by Rembrandt is The Shooting Company of Frans Banning Cocq and Willem van Ruytenburch. In the 19th century, art critics who discovered the painting thought that human figures were standing against a dark background, and it was called The Night Watch. Later it was discovered that a layer of soot made the painting dark, though the action actually takes place during the day. However, the painting replenished the treasury of famous art pieces under the name The Night Watch. The painting is kept in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.</h4>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Painted by Raphael during his early Roman period, The School of Athens depicts famous Greek philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Euclid, Socrates, Pythagoras and others. The main mystery of this fresco is hidden in the fact that many philosophers are depicted as contemporaries of Raphael: Plato as Leonardo da Vinci, Heraclitus as Michelangelo, Euclid as Bramante. This ingenious artwork of Raphael adorns the Apostolic Palace, Vatican City.

            <h4>This masterpiece, one of the most famous paintings by Raffaello Santi, also known as the Madonna di San Sisto, is kept in the Old Masters Picture Gallery in Dresden. The painting has a little secret: the background, which looks like clouds from a distance, upon close examination is the heads of angels. And the two angels depicted in the picture below have become the motif of numerous postcards and posters.</h4>
